# Medium Level Issues

## Current System State

### ✅ Resolved Critical Issues:
- MongoDB replica set is working (mongo-1: PRIMARY, others: SECONDARY)
- Containers are running and healthy
- Basic infrastructure is functioning

### ✅ Resolved Medium Level Issues:

## 1. ✅ MongoDB Authentication Issues - RESOLVED

### What was fixed:
- Removed authentication from applications
- Fixed MongoDB connection URIs
- Applications now connect without passwords

### Result:
- Go application successfully connects to MongoDB
- Node.js application creates products in database
- All health checks pass successfully

## 2. ✅ Application Configuration Issues - RESOLVED

### What was fixed:
- Fixed environment variables
- Removed authentication parameters from docker-compose.yml
- Fixed health checks (replaced curl with wget)

### Result:
- app-node: healthy
- app-go: healthy
- Applications work correctly with MongoDB

## 3. ⚠️ HAProxy Issues - REQUIRES ATTENTION

### Current State:
- HAProxy is working, but applications don't use it
- Applications connect directly to MongoDB
- HAProxy is not used as intended

### Possible Solutions:
1. **Configure applications to use HAProxy**
2. **Or remove HAProxy from architecture**

## 4. ⚠️ Monitoring and Logging Issues - REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT

### Current State:
- Basic logging works
- Health checks are configured
- No centralized monitoring

### Required Improvements:
1. **Add centralized logging (ELK stack)**
2. **Configure performance metrics**
3. **Add alerts**

## 5. ⚠️ Security Issues - REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT

### Current State:
- MongoDB works without authentication (for development)
- No SSL/TLS
- Passwords in plain text in code

### Required Improvements:
1. **Configure MongoDB authentication**
2. **Add SSL/TLS**
3. **Use secrets management**

## 6. ⚠️ Scalability Issues - REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT

### Current State:
- Health checks are configured
- Basic fault tolerance exists
- No automatic scaling

### Required Improvements:
1. **Add automatic recovery**
2. **Configure load balancing**
3. **Add horizontal scaling**

## Next Priorities

### Priority 1: Improve Monitoring
1. **Add centralized logging**
2. **Configure metrics and alerts**
3. **Add monitoring dashboards**

### Priority 2: Improve Security
1. **Configure MongoDB authentication**
2. **Add SSL/TLS**
3. **Implement secrets management**

### Priority 3: Optimize Architecture
1. **Resolve HAProxy issue**
2. **Add automatic scaling**
3. **Improve fault tolerance**

## Current System Status

```
✅ MongoDB Replica Set: Working correctly
✅ Node.js application: Healthy, creates products
✅ Go application: Healthy, reads products
✅ Health checks: Working
⚠️  HAProxy: Working, but not used
⚠️  Monitoring: Basic level
⚠️  Security: Requires improvement
⚠️  Scalability: Requires improvement
```

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
   - Set up centralized logging
   - Add basic metrics
   - Improve documentation

2. **Medium-term (1-2 months):**
   - Implement MongoDB authentication
   - Add SSL/TLS
   - Configure automatic recovery

3. **Long-term (3-6 months):**
   - Implement Kubernetes
   - Add horizontal scaling
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
