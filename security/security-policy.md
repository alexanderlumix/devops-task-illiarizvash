# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the MongoDB Replica Set project.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Network segmentation
- Access controls at multiple levels

### 2. Least Privilege
- Users and services have minimal required permissions
- Regular access reviews
- Principle of least privilege enforcement

### 3. Secure by Default
- Default secure configurations
- Security-first development practices
- Regular security assessments

## Access Control

### Authentication
- MongoDB users with role-based access control (RBAC)
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access

### Authorization
- Database-level permissions
- Collection-level access controls
- Network-level restrictions

## Network Security

### Firewall Rules
```bash
# MongoDB ports
27030-27032: MongoDB replica set members
27034: HAProxy load balancer

# Application ports
3000: Node.js application
8080: Go application
```

### Network Segmentation
- Isolated Docker networks
- Separate networks for different tiers
- VPN access for remote administration

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Data at rest: MongoDB encryption
- Data in transit: TLS/SSL encryption
- Key management: Secure key storage

### Backup Security
- Encrypted backups
- Secure backup storage
- Regular backup testing

## Vulnerability Management

### Scanning Schedule
- Weekly automated scans
- Monthly manual assessments
- Quarterly penetration testing

### Patch Management
- Security patches within 48 hours
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Incident Response

### Response Team
- Security lead
- DevOps engineer
- Database administrator

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Analysis**: Impact assessment and root cause analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Removal of threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and monitoring
6. **Lessons Learned**: Documentation and process improvement
