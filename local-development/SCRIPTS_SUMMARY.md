## 🛠️ Scripts

### 1. `setup.sh` - Automatic Installation

**Purpose:** Complete automation of local environment installation and setup

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Check and install all dependencies (Docker, Docker Compose, Go, Node.js)
- ✅ Automatic environment variable configuration
- ✅ Install application dependencies
- ✅ Create MongoDB key with proper access permissions
- ✅ Start project via Docker Compose
- ✅ Initialize MongoDB replica set
- ✅ Test applications and health checks
- ✅ Colored output with detailed logging

**Solved Issues:**
- Docker Compose installation issues
- MongoDB version issues (AVX)
- MongoDB key access permission issues
- Application authentication issues
- Health checks issues (curl → wget)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic installation
./local-development/setup.sh

# Skip dependency installation
./local-development/setup.sh --skip-deps

# Skip MongoDB initialization
./local-development/setup.sh --skip-mongo

# Force reinstallation
./local-development/setup.sh --force
```

### 2. `teardown.sh` - Environment Cleanup

**Purpose:** Complete cleanup of local project environment

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Stop and remove all project containers
- ✅ Remove Docker images, volumes and networks
- ✅ Clean Docker system
- ✅ Remove local files (.env, MongoDB key)
- ✅ Clean logs
- ✅ Complete Docker data cleanup (optional)
- ✅ Verify cleanup results

**Security:**
- Confirmation prompt before deletion
- Force cleanup option
- Cleanup result verification

**Usage:**
```bash
# Normal cleanup with confirmation
./local-development/teardown.sh

# Force cleanup
./local-development/teardown.sh --force

# Complete Docker data cleanup
./local-development/teardown.sh --full
```

### 3. `status.sh` - Status Check

**Purpose:** Quick and detailed status check of local environment

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Check all system components
- ✅ Check application health checks
- ✅ Check MongoDB replica set
- ✅ Check files and dependencies
- ✅ Check logs and resources
- ✅ Final summary with working component count
- ✅ Three check modes (quick, complete, detailed)

**Operation Modes:**
- `--quick` - Quick check of main components
- `--verbose` - Detailed check with logs and resources
- No parameters - Complete check

**Usage:**
```bash
# Quick check
./local-development/status.sh --quick

# Complete check
./local-development/status.sh

# Detailed check
./local-development/status.sh --verbose
```

## 🎯 Solved Issues

### Installation Issues:
1. **Docker Compose** - Automatic installation of current version
2. **Go** - Installation via snap for current version
3. **Node.js** - Installation of Node.js 18.x
4. **Python dependencies** - Automatic installation from requirements.txt

### MongoDB Issues:
1. **AVX issue** - Using MongoDB 4.4 instead of 6.0
2. **Access permissions** - Automatic key creation with proper permissions
3. **Replica set** - Automatic initialization
4. **Authentication** - Removed for development simplicity

### Application Issues:
1. **Health checks** - Replacing curl with wget
2. **Environment variables** - Automatic configuration
3. **MongoDB connections** - URI fixes
4. **Dependencies** - Automatic installation

### Docker Issues:
1. **Networks** - Automatic creation and cleanup
2. **Volumes** - Data management
3. **Images** - Cleanup of unused resources

## 🚀 Advantages

### Automation:
- Complete installation automation
- Idempotency (can be run multiple times)
- Error handling and recovery

### Security:
- Access permission checks
- Confirmation before deletion
- Project isolation

### Convenience:
- Colored output with detailed logging
- Various operation modes
- Detailed documentation

### Reliability:
- Check all components
- Functionality testing
- Result validation

## 📋 Team Usage

### For new developers:
```bash
# Clone project
git clone <repository>
cd devops-task-illiarizvash

# Install environment
./local-development/setup.sh

# Check status
./local-development/status.sh --quick
```

### For daily work:
```bash
# Check status
./local-development/status.sh

# Restart project
./local-development/teardown.sh
./local-development/setup.sh

# Clean for space saving
./local-development/teardown.sh --force
```

### For debugging:
```bash
# Detailed check
./local-development/status.sh --verbose

# Check logs
docker logs app-node
docker logs app-go
```

## 🔧 Aliases for Convenience

Add to `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
alias dev-setup="./local-development/setup.sh"
alias dev-clean="./local-development/teardown.sh"
alias dev-status="./local-development/status.sh"
```

Usage:
```bash
dev-setup      # Installation
dev-status     # Status check
dev-clean      # Cleanup
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
